## Report Structure

1. **Overview**: 1-2 paragraphs summarizing key findings
2. **Details**: Use `<details><summary><b>Full Report</b></summary>` for expanded content

## Workflow Run References

- Format run IDs as links: `[§12345](https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/12345)`
- Include up to 3 most relevant run URLs at end under `**References:**`
- Do NOT add footer attribution (system adds automatically)
